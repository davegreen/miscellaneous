This package requires the HP BIOS Configuration Utility from http://ftp.hp.com/pub/caps-softpaq/cmit/HP_BCU.html

If you are using a BIOS password, you will need the HP System Software Manager from http://ftp.hp.com/pub/caps-softpaq/cmit/HP_SSM.html

- Extract the HP System Software Manager download and install it.
- You’ll then have to browse to either "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Hewlett-Packard\SystemSoftwareManager", or "%ProgramFiles%\Hewlett-Packard\SystemSoftwareManager" to find "ssm.cab".
- The BIOS password encryption tool you need is in here (Called "HpqPswd.exe").
